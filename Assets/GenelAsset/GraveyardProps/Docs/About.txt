Thanks for buying this little pack, we hope to be adding more props as time goes by. Feel free to request props for this pack me@robertramsay.co.uk

It currently includes a mesh for the sky, fog particle effect, shadow catcher shader (may be tempremental but just really for effect as the sky dome is set to not recieve shadows)

Very simple rotation script added for the skydone, directional light is childed to follow the moon.


Hope you enjoy this pack!
